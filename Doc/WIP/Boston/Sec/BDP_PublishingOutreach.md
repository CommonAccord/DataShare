Ti=Outreach to stakeholder communities

sec=The business contact for Open Data of each department shall endeavor to identify the relevant stakeholder communities that will use and rely upon the publication of each open data set of their department, including identification of a simple, effective and repeatable means for notifying stakeholder communities of the availability of relevant published open data or the additions to or other updating of such open data.

Comment=The identification of stakeholders appears to have strong links with the determination of priority publishing status. By identifying groups most dependent on the data, departments will be determining which groups need the data the most. The organization of this policy may benefit by adding the stakeholder's section into the list of due factors to be considered in measuring publishing priority.
