Note=INSTRUCTIONS (delete instructions upon completing the data use agreement): The Data Use Agreement template is to be used for research that exchanges limited PHI with a non-SLU entity. The PHI being shared/exchanged should qualify as a limited data set. A limited data set may be used for the purpose of research, public health, or health care operations. A limited data set is PHI that excludes direct identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual.

Note=If your research requires the use of a data use agreement, a copy of the signed agreement (by both parties) should be submitted to the IRB office with other research materials for review. A copy of the agreement should also be retained by both parties involved in the research as an assurance of this agreement.
